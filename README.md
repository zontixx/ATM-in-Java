# ATM-in-Java
A simple Bank ATM system in Java.

This is a Java program that creates ten accounts in an array with id 0, 1, . . . , 9, and initial balance as $100. The system prompts the user to enter an ID. If the ID is entered incorrectly, asks the user to enter a correct ID. Once the ID is accepted, the main menu is displayed as shown in the sample run. Users can enter a choice 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once the user exits, the system prompts for an id again.

Sample run:
